# MuseUI

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

MuseUI is a browser-only AI interface and image design generator. It helps you create UI mockups, social images, covers, infographics, stickers, logos, and other visual drafts from prompts and reference images.

The app is a static Vite + React SPA. It has no backend, no authentication, and no server database. Users provide their own AI API keys in the browser settings, and those keys are stored locally in the browser.

## Features

- Text-to-image UI mockup generation
- Multi-provider API configuration for Gemini and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Canvas workspace with generated artboards
- Reference image, color, and layout inputs
- Skill modes for covers, infographics, comics, slide decks, logos, stickers, and more
- Local IndexedDB project and history storage
- Bilingual UI: English and Chinese

## Non-goals

- MuseUI does not provide hosted AI APIs, bundled API keys, or a backend proxy.
- MuseUI does not upload projects, generated images, or API settings to a MuseUI server.
- MuseUI is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any AI provider or brand referenced in design templates.

## Privacy Model

- API keys are stored in browser localStorage.
- Projects and generated history are stored locally in IndexedDB.
- The app does not ship with any backend service.
- No API key is required at build time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on `http://localhost:3003` by default.

### Configure AI APIs

Open the app and use the API settings button in the top-right corner.

Recommended official endpoints:

- Gemini: leave Base URL empty for the official API, or use `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
- OpenAI text: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- OpenAI image: `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations`

The app is designed to be configured through the browser UI. `.env.example` is intentionally only a local notes file; no API key is required at build time.

MuseUI is not affiliated with those brands, and users are responsible for ensuring that generated outputs comply with applicable trademark, copyright, platform, and usage rules.
