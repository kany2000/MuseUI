# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately through GitHub Security Advisories for this repository:

https://github.com/Leochens/MuseUI/security/advisories/new

Do not open a public issue containing credentials, exploit details, or private user data. If GitHub private vulnerability reporting is unavailable, contact the repository owner privately through their GitHub profile and include a minimal description of the affected area.

## Supported Versions

MuseUI is early-stage open-source software. Security fixes are handled on the default branch first, then released from tagged versions when available.

## Credential Handling

MuseUI is a client-side app. Users configure their own AI provider keys in the browser. Those keys are stored locally by the browser and are not sent to any MuseUI backend.

Never commit:

- `.env` files
- API keys
- Database URLs
- Webhook URLs
- Access tokens
- Cloud storage secrets

If a credential is accidentally committed, revoke and rotate it immediately. Removing it from the latest commit is not enough if it has entered Git history.
