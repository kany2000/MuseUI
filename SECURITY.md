# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the project maintainers. Do not open a public issue containing credentials, exploit details, or private user data.

## Credential Handling

Muse UI is a client-side app. Users configure their own AI provider keys in the browser. Those keys are stored locally by the browser and are not sent to any Muse UI backend.

Never commit:

- `.env` files
- API keys
- Database URLs
- Webhook URLs
- Access tokens
- Cloud storage secrets

If a credential is accidentally committed, revoke and rotate it immediately. Removing it from the latest commit is not enough if it has entered Git history.
